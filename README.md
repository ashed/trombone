Trombone
========

This is an experimental rewrite of Trombone (version 4), the back-end system
for Voyant Tools. Please note that everything here is in flux and likely to
change. In fact, this entire codebase may be abandoned if significant
difficulties are encountered. If you're interested in the current version of
Voyant Tools (version 3.x available through
[voyant-tools.org)[http://voyant-tools.org/], please see 
[here] (http://dev.hermeneuti.ca/~hermeneutica/voyeur/trac/)
instead.

Trombone is a multi-purpose text analysis library. It makes it relatively easy
to create corpora from a variety of sources (URLs, files, strings, etc.) and in
a variety of formats (XML, HTML, PDF, etc.). Some basic term frequency,
distribution, and keyword-in-context functionality is available (intended for
use by more sophisticated front-end interfaces like Voyant Tools).
